# GTA-On-Mission-Changer

## What is this?

This is the GTA On Mission Changer that can be used to test "on mission flag" related dupes in GTA 3, VC or SA.
I decided to make the code publicly available so people can help improve it if they want. I will check the issues and pull requests every now and then and release a new version if needed.

The code could be cleaner but it was made rather quickly years ago when I was still fairly new to programming so I guess it's all right.

## Where to download the latest version?

You can find the latest version on the [Releases tab](https://github.com/Earleys/GTA-On-Mission-Changer/releases)
